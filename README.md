# Schema Documentation

We would like people to use the schema once it's done so we're going to have to provide additional resources beyond our source code.

## Current Status

Pretty minimal at the moment.

-   Rules, Definitions, Expressions, Operators etc are defined at [bids-specification/src/schema/README.md](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/tree/master/src/schema)
-   The python library for rendering/working with the schema is on RTD at [https://bidsschematools.readthedocs.io/](https://bidsschematools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Goals

-   Modify [bids-specification/src/schema/README.md](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/tree/master/src/schema)

    -   Is it better to leave the information in this document all in one place?
    -   Add companion documentation with examples to the rendered spec?

-   Demonstrate how to use our library to work with the schema

    -   Flesh out the bidsschematools docs website

-   Update [bids.neuroimaging.io](bids.neuroimaging.io)

    -   It might be best to tell people there about the schema

-   Creating a _how to_ schematize your BEP/BIDS addition
    -   Again where should this go? Website, spec, etc.
-   Get consensus on how much Schema should appear in the rendered spec? E.g. things like
    this [this](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schema/index.html#bids-schema)
